1. Short answer

a. Name the differences between imperative and functional programming

Imperative programming is the most dominant paradigm of programming.
Its when you use loops and other to create your programming
The main difference between imperative and functional languages is that functions that are evaluated are the
main way of gaining and transforming data,
functional programming is stateless. Rather than assigning values which can then be mutated like what happens
in imperative languages, the value returned by a function is only dependent on its input.



b. Explain the meaning of declarative programming. Give an example.





c. Name the benefits of including functional style programming in Java
